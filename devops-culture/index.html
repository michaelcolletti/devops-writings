<h3 id="devops-as-cultural-movement-and-historical-moment">DevOps as Cultural Movement and Historical Moment</h3>
<ul>
<li>There's a bit to unpack here. </li>
<li>The following words are just my thoughts as observer and student.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="perez-and-gouldner">Perez and Gouldner</h4>
<p>These are my personal thoughts about the DevOps cultural movement. More specifically as it relates to two things: Dr. Carlota Perez's Age of Software and the ascendence of Dr. Alvin Gouldners's New Class in Late Capitalism(1). </p>
<h4 id="the-devops-cultural-movement">The DevOps Cultural Movement</h4>
<p>I speak specifically about the DevOps <em>cultural movement</em>(2), as envisioned by the original adopters <a href="https://michaelcolletti.github.io/project-newjam/devops/">reference</a> not tooling or even the many aspects that the term may engender. I learned these things as an extremely fortunate connection to one of the greatest minds in the industry. More on this later. </p>
<h4 id="intro">Intro</h4>
<p>A little about me. I was a Sociology/Cultural Anthropology/Music i.e. conservatory composition student/musician at an art school filled with amazing musicians, artists, poets, writers and all kinds of cool humans Interestingly enough Uni is a place where these interactions occur seemingly organically. I think this experience makes one yearn for this later in life. When I find a gig with all kinds of folks, languages, shapes, looks, sounds of dialects, FOOD DISCOVERIES, it makes me feel at home. Diversity is our natural state and having diversity is the most healthy thing. It's absence is sickly.</p>
<h4 id="cutural-anthropology-critical-social-theory-and-sociology-of">Cutural Anthropology, Critical Social Theory and Sociology of</h4>
<p>It was in this conext that I was studying Cultural Anthopology and Sociology and studying Critical Social Theory while being a TA for my professor, Dr. Jeffrey Halley. I briefly studied the Sociology of Technology and attended some graduate classes with Dr. Henry Eskowitcz. I had the good fortune of Prof Louis Amdur as a transformative influence as an advisor. The fusion of Cultural Anthopology, Critical Social Theory and Sociology would be the introduction to many mind-blowing ideas; touchstones that would further inform my frame of DevOps as a cultural movement. As a senior project, I obsessed over <em>Towards a Political Econoomy of The New Class</em>. It was here that I started to understand attributes of <em>the cultue of critical discourse</em> and the New Class.  It was the Critical Social theory part is where I realized <em>how</em> it creates a natural and beneficial symmetry around the economic imperitives of market demadeds. In some ways, Amazon's being customer obsessed_ is the ultimate triumph of this capitalist spirit_. More about this later when we delve into Deming as DevOps singularity with the ultimate <em>spanner</em> DevOps Maven, @botchagalupe</p>
<p>As I learned more about DevOps and saw it's incorporation into the and just as importantly a historical moment.  before cooptation and cultural hegemony. </p>
<h4 id="westrum-and-goulner">Westrum and Goulner</h4>
<ul>
<li>(Broader comparisons and allignemnts between Gouldner (beauracracies) and Ron Westrum typlologies go here)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="devops-as-cultural-hedgemony">DevOps as Cultural Hedgemony</h4>
<ul>
<li>When Edwards/Humble inserted Lean into the CAMS acronym CA(L)MS (Edwards/Willis DevOps Cafe'), it embeded a visible expression; a self-awareness of Lean as intrinsticly part of DevOps; an acknoledgement of the <em>agile admin practices</em> as prime-mover. This alone would not necessarily create the adoption that the transformed the industry and ,arguably history, dramatically. That would require something bigger; more than just a way of working and tooling. Enter DevOpsDays. </li>

<li>Flywheel of Cultural Adoption: Local, grass-roots A fusion of community, commerce and cultural affinities (ways of working). </li>
<li>Small is beautiful local optimization global reach</li>
<li>It is with this  a way of working seeing Ideology</li>

<h4 id="dr-forsgren-as-devops-data-and-metrics-singularity">Dr. Forsgren As DevOps Data and Metrics Singularity</h4>
<p>The influence of Dr. Forsgren in this and other areas has not been adaquately recognized. She really is, IMHO, the Singualarity for data/Metrics (or the M in CALMs) in DevOps. The State of DevOps, Accelerate and DORA make this completely clear for me.  It is also no coinsidence that she is also a woman. Her impact on the industry with her book and talks are seminal. Her, and other women leaders, treatment by tech bros is reprehensible and unforgivable. This context is alone why the industry has nothing to congratuate themselves about. </p>
