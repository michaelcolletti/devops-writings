<ul>
<li>
<p>There's a bit to unpack here. 
<em>The following words are just my thoughts as observer and student. I just started writing. Probably not a good idea.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>*TLdR; I wrote a research paper thirty two years ago. The developments alligned with Gouldner's observations and theories are oddly, coincidentally prescient.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="intro">Intro</h4>
<p>A little about me. I was a Sociology/Cultural Anthropology/Music i.e. conservatory composition student/musician at an art school filled with amazing musicians, artists, poets, writers and all kinds of cool humans Interestingly enough Uni is a place where these interactions occur seemingly organically. I think this experience makes one yearn for this later in life. When I find a gig with all kinds of folks, languages, shapes, looks, sounds of dialects, FOOD DISCOVERIES, it makes me feel at home. Diversity is our natural state and having diversity is the most healthy thing. It's absence is sickly.</p>
<h4 id="perez-and-gouldner">Perez and Gouldner</h4>
<p>These are my personal thoughts about the DevOps cultural movement. More specifically as it relates to two things: Dr. Carlota Perez's Age of Software and the ascendence of Dr. Alvin Gouldner's <em>New Class</em>. </p>
<h4 id="the-devops-cultural-movement">The DevOps Cultural Movement</h4>
<p>I speak specifically about the DevOps <em>cultural movement</em>(2), as shared by the original adopters/participants <a href="https://michaelcolletti.github.io/project-newjam/devops/">reference</a> not tooling or even the many aspects that the term may engender. I realized that a great deal of what is below does not focus heavily on the extraordinary humans of early devops adoption. They deserve a volume of their own. I learned these things as an extremely fortunate connection to one of the greatest minds in the industry. More on this later. </p>
<h4 id="cutural-anthropology-critical-social-theory-and-sociology-of">Cutural Anthropology, Critical Social Theory and Sociology of .....</h4>
<p>It was in this context that I was studying Cultural Anthropology and Sociology and studying Critical Social Theory while being a TA for my professor, Dr. Jeffrey Halley. I briefly studied the Sociology of Technology and attended some graduate classes with Dr. Henry Eskowitcz (Sociology of Technology). I had the good fortune of Prof Louis Amdur's guidence as an advisor. The fusion of Cultural Anthropology, Critical Social Theory and Sociology would be the introduction to many mind-blowing ideas; touchstones that would further inform my frame of DevOps as a cultural movement. As a senior project, I obsessed over <em>Towards a Political Economy of The New Class</em>. It was here that I started to understand attributes of <em>the culture of critical discourse</em> and the New Class. I also had the extreme privilege to briefly study under, and better yet, hang out with Dr Alfred Williner <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Action_image_of_Society_on_Cultural.html?id=6dgYAAAAYAAJ">The Action Image of Society</a>. It was the Critical Social theory part is where I realized <em>how</em> culture creates a natural and beneficial symmetry around the imperatives of the economic order. Instead of Weber's Protestant Ethic as disruptor, a catalyst of religious origin, moderns embrace the ideology and systemic secular constructs of the New Class. In some ways, Amazon's being customer obsessed_ is the ultimate triumph of this capitalist spirit_ and ascendence of the New Class. </p>
<h4 id="willis-and-demings-sopk">Willis and Deming's SoPK</h4>
<p>Dr. W edwards Deming as DevOps prime-mover from the ultimate <em>spanner</em>, DevOps Maven and Deming scholar, John Willis aka @botchagalupe. I'll post some references to his works. John's talks through the years frame the importance of Deming in DevOps and beyond.</p>
<h4 id="devops-stickiness-and-absorbtion">DevOps Stickiness and Absorbtion</h4>
<p>As I learned more about DevOps and saw it's adoption as a movement (thanks to the Godfather  @patrickdebois and DevOpsDays organizers community grassroots distributed model) it was just as importantly a significant historical moment. It was momentary (historically speaking) though absorption of ideals; a cultural hegemony of DevOps as default posture for high performing IT organizations. Was this just commoditization and evidence of Perez's deployment phase in the <em>Age of Software</em>?</p>
<p>In the Northeast, what I was encountering in my consulting was a conspicuous lack of tooling and automation adoption in certain types of orgs (large bureaucracy) and I wondered where the lowest parts of the DORA assessments went if they were eliminated from even the laggards catagory (no config-management). I understood very well the things that militated against their success. Generally these things were related to business processes and management and attitudes towards change, speed and risk. I understood the concepts but there was a cultural resistance in traditional contexts especially noticeable in configuration management adoption or continuous integration/delivery areas. yes, it had to do with core-chronic conflict and change, but there was something else going on. I started seeing some correlations between types of orgs, their bureaucracy typologies, their <em>vibe</em> (enter Dr. Westrum's typologies) and their technological maturity. When I read <em>Accelerate</em> and _The DevOps Handbook_so many of these things made more sense. </p>
<h4 id="hermeutics-and-devops">Hermeutics and DevOps</h4>
<p>When companies try to sell DevOps , I'm reminded of the ways TPS is emulated though imitation which is destined to fail because the cultural and way of working and seeing is not embraced (Toyota Kata/Rother). </p>
<h4 id="westrum-and-goulner">Westrum and Goulner</h4>
<ul>
<li>(Broader comparisons and allignemnts between Gouldner (beauracracies) and Westrum typlologies go here)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="devops-as-cultural-hegemony">DevOps as Cultural Hegemony</h4>
<ul>
<li>When Edwards/Humble inserted Lean into the CAMS acronym CA(L)MS (Edwards/Willis DevOps Cafe'), it embeded a visible expression; a self-awareness of Lean as intrinsticly part of DevOps; an acknoledgement of the <em>agile admin practices</em> as prime-mover. This alone would not necessarily create the adoption that the transformed the industry and ,arguably history, dramatically. That would require something bigger; more than just a way of working and tooling. Enter DevOpsDays. </li>
</ul>
<h5 id="devopsdays-as-cultural-phenomena">DevOpsDays as Cultural Phenomena</h5>
<ul>
<li>Flywheel of Cultural Adoption: Local, grass-roots A fusion of community, commerce and cultural affinities (ways of working). </li>
<li>Small is beautiful local optimization global reach</li>
<li>Help spread the practices and behaviors and adoption of Agile Infrastructure Shaefer</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="devops-as-bourdieus-cultural-capital">DevOps as Bourdieu's Cultural Capital</h5>
<p>Perre Bourdieu's theory of educational and cultural capital is quite well known. I use the term cultural capital in DevOps as not just the tooling knowledge but also the cannon from years of conversation (mostly twitter interactions and conference talks). These would be the Ben Rockwood, Hammond/Alspaw, Forsgren/Shortridge level talks. </p>
<h4 id="devops-and-sre-as-cultural-identifier">DevOps and SRE as Cultural Identifier</h4>
<p>When tribal knowledge is discussed in tech or DevOps (Seven Deadly Sins/Willis), it discribes an understood 'tribal' notion. There are cultural and  anthrpological lessons tbe learned from cultural idemntifiers in social orders and these artifacts have meaning and enforce 'rules and dominant ideology'. </p>
<h4 id="calms">CALMS</h4>
<ul>
<li>The self-awareness of culture in CALMS is an expression of New Class Ideals of culture and behavior modificaton as an expression</li>
<li>Feedback systems allow for renewal and change</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="kaizen-and-the-culture-of-critical-discourse">Kaizen and the Culture of Critical Discourse</h4>
<p>This will be dope to learn about and take a deeper dive</p>
<h4 id="dr-forsgren-as-devops-data-and-metrics-singularity">Dr. Forsgren As DevOps Data and Metrics Singularity</h4>
<p>IMHO the influence of Dr. Forsgren has not been adaquately recognized. She really is the Singualarity for Metrics (or the M in CALMs) in DevOps. The State of DevOps, Accelerate and DORA make this completely clear.  It is also no coincidence that she is also a woman. Her, and many other women leaders, treatment by tech bros and other misogynists is reprehensible and unforgivable. This context and just plain toxicity and treatment of women (and PoC) is why the industry has nothing to congratuate itself about.</p>
