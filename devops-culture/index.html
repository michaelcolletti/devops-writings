                <h3 id="devops-as-cultural-movement-and-historical-moment">DevOps as Cultural Movement and Historical Moment</h3>
<ul>
<li>There's a bit to unpack here. </li>
<li>
<p>The following words are just my thoughts as observer and student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>*TLdR; I wrote a research paper thirty two years ago. The developments alligned with it are oddly, coincidentally prescient.  A Tech <em>New Class</em> as an ascendence of a new dominant ideology and how that came about</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="perez-and-gouldner">Perez and Gouldner</h4>
<p>These are my personal thoughts about the DevOps cultural movement. More specifically as it relates to two things: Dr. Carlota Perez's Age of Software and the ascendence of Dr. Alvin Gouldners's New Class. </p>
<h4 id="the-devops-cultural-movement">The DevOps Cultural Movement</h4>
<p>I speak specifically about the DevOps <em>cultural movement</em>(2), as envisioned by the original adopters <a href="https://michaelcolletti.github.io/project-newjam/devops/">reference</a> not tooling or even the many aspects that the term may engender. I realized that a great deal of what is below does not focus heavily on the extraordinary humans of early devops adoption. They deserve a volume of their own. I learned these things as an extremely fortunate connection to one of the greatest minds in the industry. More on this later. </p>
<h4 id="intro">Intro</h4>
<p>A little about me. I was a Sociology/Cultural Anthropology/Music i.e. conservatory composition student/musician at an art school filled with amazing musicians, artists, poets, writers and all kinds of cool humans Interestingly enough Uni is a place where these interactions occur seemingly organically. I think this experience makes one yearn for this later in life. When I find a gig with all kinds of folks, languages, shapes, looks, sounds of dialects, FOOD DISCOVERIES, it makes me feel at home. Diversity is our natural state and having diversity is the most healthy thing. It's absence is sickly.</p>
<h4 id="cutural-anthropology-critical-social-theory-and-sociology-of">Cutural Anthropology, Critical Social Theory and Sociology of .....</h4>
<p>It was in this conext that I was studying Cultural Anthopology and Sociology and studying Critical Social Theory while being a TA for my professor, Dr. Jeffrey Halley. I briefly studied the Sociology of Technology and attended some graduate classes with Dr. Henry Eskowitcz. I had the good fortune of Prof Louis Amdur as a transformative influence as an advisor. The fusion of Cultural Anthopology, Critical Social Theory and Sociology would be the introduction to many mind-blowing ideas; touchstones that would further inform my frame of DevOps as a cultural movement. As a senior project, I obsessed over <em>Towards a Political Econoomy of The New Class</em>. It was here that I started to understand attributes of <em>the cultue of critical discourse</em> and the New Class.   I also had the extreme priiivilledge to briefly study under and better yet, hang out with Dr Alred Williner <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Action_image_of_Society_on_Cultural.html?id=6dgYAAAAYAAJ">The Action Image of Society</a>. It was the Critical Social theory part is where I realized <em>how</em> it creates a natural and beneficial symmetry around the economic imperitives of market demadeds. In some ways, Amazon's being customer obsessed_ is the ultimate triumph of this capitalist spirit_. More about this later when we delve into Deming as DevOps singularity with the ultimate <em>spanner</em> DevOps Maven, @botchagalupe</p>
<p>As I learned more about DevOps and saw it's incorporation into the and just as importantly a historical moment.  It was momentary (historically speaking) though cooptation and cultural hegemony of DevOps as default.  There is cultural resistance in traditional contexts especially noticable in configuration management adoption or continuous integration/delivery areas. </p>
<h4 id="westrum-and-goulner">Westrum and Goulner</h4>
<ul>
<li>(Broader comparisons and allignemnts between Gouldner (beauracracies) and Ron Westrum typlologies go here)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="devops-as-cultural-hegemony">DevOps as Cultural Hegemony</h4>
<ul>
<li>When Edwards/Humble inserted Lean into the CAMS acronym CA(L)MS (Edwards/Willis DevOps Cafe'), it embeded a visible expression; a self-awareness of Lean as intrinsticly part of DevOps; an acknoledgement of the <em>agile admin practices</em> as prime-mover. This alone would not necessarily create the adoption that the transformed the industry and ,arguably history, dramatically. That would require something bigger; more than just a way of working and tooling. Enter DevOpsDays. </li>
</ul>
<h5 id="devopsdays-as-cultural-phenomena">DevOpsDays as Cultural Phenomena</h5>
<ul>
<li>Flywheel of Cultural Adoption: Local, grass-roots A fusion of community, commerce and cultural affinities (ways of working). </li>
<li>Small is beautiful local optimization global reach</li>
<li>Help spread the practices and behaviors and adoption of Agile Infrastructure Shaefer</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="devops-as-bourdieus-cultural-capital">DevOps as Bourdieu's Cultural Capital</h5>
<p>Perre Bourdieu's theory of educational and cultural capital is quite well known. I use the term cultural capital in DevOps as not just the tooling knowledge but also the cannon from years of conversation (mostly twitter interactions and conference talks). These would be the Ben Rockwood, Hammond/Alspaw, Forsgren/Shortridge level talks. </p>
<h4 id="devops-and-sre-as-cultural-identifier">DevOps and SRE as Cultural Identifier</h4>
<p>When tribal knowledge is discussed in tech or DevOps (Seven Deadly Sins/Willis), it discribes an understood 'tribal' notion. There are cultural and  anthrpological lessons tbe learned from cultural idemntifiers in social orders and these artifacts have meaning and enforce 'rules and dominant ideology'. </p>
<h4 id="kaizen-and-the-culture-of-critical-discourse">Kaizen and the Culture of Critical Discourse</h4>
<ul>
<li>The self-awareness of culture in CALMS is an expression of New Class Ideals of culture and behavior modificaton as an expression</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dr-forsgren-as-devops-data-and-metrics-singularity">Dr. Forsgren As DevOps Data and Metrics Singularity</h4>
<p>IMHO the influence of Dr. Forsgren has not been adaquately recognized. She really is the Singualarity for Metrics (or the M in CALMs) in DevOps. The State of DevOps, Accelerate and DORA make this completely clear.  It is also no coincidence that she is also a woman. Her, and other women leaders, treatment by tech bros is reprehensible and unforgivable. This context and just plain toxicity and treatment of women (and PoC) is why the industry has nothing to congratuate themselves about.</p>
